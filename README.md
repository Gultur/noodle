### A project for school 

Where are a three members team of students, we are **learning** web-development in Laval(France)

The aim is to create an interactive quiz :
* Teachers can make questions, linked them to a quiz
* Teachers load the quiz and then the students can answer in real time
* We need to handle few types of question like : 
    * true or false
    * multiple answers 
    * simple answer

#### Used Technologies :
* Symfony 3.4, php 5.6 on server
* jQuery / AJAX
* Versionning with Git (yeah, without it you couldn't read it)
